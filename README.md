## Assignment 1  
It contains various datasets of a graph as shown:  
    1. wiki-Vote  
    2. p2p-Gnutella04  
    3. p2p-Gnutella06  

Under each dataset, there are files which describes the properties of a graph as given:  
    1. Degree Distribution  
    2. Diameter  
    3. Geodesic path length  
    4. Clustering Coefficient   
    5. Strongly Connected Components  
    6. Sparseness  
    7. k-connectedness  
   
#### Requirements
1. networkx  
2. matplotlib.pyplot  
3. pandas  

#### Executing files 
1. Locate the path of given dataset.  
2. Execute files in terminal using python command.  
Example:  
Name of file is name.py  
Go to terminal > python name.py  
Press Enter.

## Assignment 2  
It contains various datasets of a graph as shown:  
    1. wiki-Vote  
    2. p2p-Gnutella04  
    3. p2p-Gnutella06  

Under each dataset, there are files which describes the properties of graph using three models:  
1. Erdos Renyi  
2. Watts Strogatz  
3. Barabasi Albert  

#### Requirements
1. networkx  
2. matplotlib.pyplot  

#### Executing files 
1. Input for 3 models are already considered in code according to the nodes and edges given in dataset. 
2. Visit https://colab.research.google.com/ and upload the files.  
3. Execute the code.
